# WeebTranslator 
Translates from English to Weebenese! Impress your Japanophile friends.

WeebTranslator is a simple Flask application that was created as a part of the TerribleHacks Day (2018) at Carleton University. 
It leverages Google Translate's API to retrieve translated Japanese text and uses natural language libraries and romanization  
libraries to help with the translation (from English to Weeb).  

It's a fun little project and I hope to refine the English to Weeb translation scheme to make it more authentic in the future!
